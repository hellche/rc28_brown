    "text": "Appendix 1. Automated Occupation Categorization with ChatGPT: Methodology Overview\nTo categorize occupations into fields of study, we utilized the ChatGPT powered by the OpenAI natural language model. For this study, we constructed the prompt used to interpret and classify 214 occupations (KidB 92 classification) into nine fields of study (DZHW Destatis-Fächersystematik), along with an Outside the area structure category. The natural language model within ChatGPT tracked the categorization process by analyzing the descriptions of occupations and assigning them to the most appropriate fields according to the given criteria. This automated approach simplified the categorization task, although it is not the sole method we are considering. We are now exploring and developing other approaches based on utilizing classifications from other datasets and developing classifications from real-world data.\n\nPROMPT:\nI will give you a list of occupations. \nYou need to indicate for each of the occupations only one and the most relevant of the following nine fields:\n\n1 Language and cultural sciences\n2 Sports\n3 Legal, economic and social sciences\n4 Mathematics, natural sciences\n5 Medicine, health care sciences\n6 Veterinary medicine\n7 Agricultural forestry and nutritional sciences\n8 Engineering sciences\n9 Art, aesthetics\n10 Outside the area structure\n\n\nExample of my request:\n\ncode;kldb\n011;Farmers, crop protection specialists\n283;Aircraft, aircraft engine mechanics, aircraft builders\n691;Bank clerks\n801;Soldiers, border patrol, police officers\n997;Other workers without designation\n \n\nExample of your answer:\n\ncode;kldb;field \n011;Farmers, crop protection specialists;7 Agricultural forestry and nutritional sciences\n283;Aircraft, aircraft engine mechanics, aircraft builders;8 Engineering sciences\n691;Bank clerks; 3 Legal, economic and social sciences\n801;Soldiers, border patrol, police officers; 10 Outside the area structure\n997;Other workers without designation; 10 Outside the area structure \n\n\nRESULT:"

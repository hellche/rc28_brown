<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appendix-1.-automated-occupation-categorization-with-chatgpt-methodology-overview">Appendix 1. Automated Occupation Categorization with ChatGPT: Methodology Overview</h4>
<p>To categorize occupations into fields of study, we utilized the ChatGPT powered by the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction">OpenAI</a> natural language model. For this study, we constructed the prompt used to interpret and classify <em>214 occupations</em> (KidB 92 classification) into <em>nine fields of study</em> (DZHW Destatis-FÃ¤chersystematik), along with an <code>Outside the area structure</code> category. The natural language model within ChatGPT tracked the categorization process by analyzing the descriptions of occupations and assigning them to the most appropriate fields according to the given criteria. This automated approach simplified the categorization task, although it is not the sole method we are considering. We are now exploring and developing other approaches based on utilizing classifications from other datasets and developing classifications from real-world data.</p>
<section id="prompt" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prompt">PROMPT:</h5>
<pre style="color: grey; background: black"><code>I will give you a list of occupations. 
You need to indicate for each of the occupations only one and the most relevant of the following nine fields:

1 Language and cultural sciences
2 Sports
3 Legal, economic and social sciences
4 Mathematics, natural sciences
5 Medicine, health care sciences
6 Veterinary medicine
7 Agricultural forestry and nutritional sciences
8 Engineering sciences
9 Art, aesthetics
10 Outside the area structure


Example of my request:

code;kldb
011;Farmers, crop protection specialists
283;Aircraft, aircraft engine mechanics, aircraft builders
691;Bank clerks
801;Soldiers, border patrol, police officers
997;Other workers without designation
 

Example of your answer:

code;kldb;field&nbsp;
011;Farmers, crop protection specialists;7 Agricultural forestry and nutritional sciences
283;Aircraft, aircraft engine mechanics, aircraft builders;8 Engineering sciences
691;Bank clerks; 3 Legal, economic and social sciences
801;Soldiers, border patrol, police officers; 10 Outside the area structure
997;Other workers without designation; 10 Outside the area structure </code></pre>
